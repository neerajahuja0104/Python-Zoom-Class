3.Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.
Recommended Swap Space based on RAM amount:
2GB for <=4GB
4GB for 4-16GB
8GB for 16-64GB
16GB for 64-256GB
32GB for 256-512GB RAM.

4.Task can be scheduled using crontab command with syntax: A B C D E USERNAME /path/to/command/ arg1 arg2	OR	A B C D E USERNAME /root/backup.sh - where
A is Minutes (0-59)
B is Hours (0-23)
C is Days (0-30)
D is Months (0-11)
E is Days of Week (0-6)
USERNAME replace this with your username
/path/to/command is the name of script or command to schedule
Operator symbols:	* for all possible values for a field; , for a list of values; - for a range of values; / for a step value

5.No O/P as -v prints all lines that do not match the pattern here 'hello'
hello as -i ignores case for matching
hello as there is only hello in file else it would have printed two lines above the line containing hello, too
hello as there is only hello in file else it would have printed four lines above and below the line containing hello, too
hello as there is only hello in file else it would have printed three lines below the line containing hello, too
gives a fully formated list of active processes related to more
It will split the lines with space as delimiter by default and provide the words from second to fifth ($2,$5) in the each record as O/P

6.The export command is one of the bash shell BUILTINS commands, which means it is part of your shell. The export command is fairly simple to use as it has straightforward syntax with only three available command options. In general, the export command marks an environment variable to be exported with any newly forked child processes and thus it allows a child process to inherit all marked variables. Example -
$ a=linuxcareer.com
$ echo $a
linuxcareer.com
$ bash
$ echo $a

$
The above code is an O/P
